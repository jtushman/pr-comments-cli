2. Set the token in your environment:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

## Usage

Navigate to your git repository and run:

```bash
pr-comments
```

## Using with LLM Tools

PR Comments CLI works great with AI coding assistants like Windsurf and Cursor. Here's how you can integrate it into your workflow:

Simply ask Windsurf or Cursor to run `pr-comments` to get a list of all unresolved PR comments. and to organize and work through them


### General LLM Workflow

A typical workflow might look like:

1. Run `pr-comments` to see all unresolved feedback
2. Ask your AI assistant to help you understand and implement the suggested changes
3. Make the necessary code modifications with AI assistance
4. Run tests to ensure your changes work as expected
5. Push your changes and mark the comments as resolved

This workflow helps you leverage AI tools to more efficiently address code review feedback, improving both productivity and code quality.
